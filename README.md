# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Overview of analysis. Pewlett_Hackard is facing the prospect of having over 57k senior staff potentially retire in the next year. The ability to replace those employees could have significant implications for the company.
### Results of analysis by title.
  1. Over 83k employees are eligibTle to retire in the next year.
  2. Over 57k of those emplees are senior engineers or senior staff. This will leave a void among the senior leadership of the company.
  3. It will be very difficult to find, hire and train that many staff in a timely fashion. There could be a very bumpy tranistion period.
  4. This upcoming 'Brain Drain' could be very disruptive unless the next generation of senior leaders can quickly step-up and fill the void left due to retirement.
### Results of analysis of potential mentorship.
  1. Only 1550 employees met the criteria to qualify for the mentorship.
  2. This number is not sufficient to train the next generation of company leaders that are needed.
  3. The criteria to become a mentor needs to be expanded to qualify more senior people as mentors.
  4. A retention program may need to be created to slow the number of retirements so that the impact can be spread over a longer period. This will allow the company 
     time to adjust to the turnover.
### Conclusion. 
    PH is facing a difficult upheaval if all of the potential retirements happen in such a short period of time. Programs need to be developed to spread this over a longer time period. This will allow more mentors to be available and help ease the transition. This will allow more time to attract new and highly qualified employees to replace the retiring employees. This will hopefully lessen the disruption internally and allow PH to remain competitive versus their peers.
